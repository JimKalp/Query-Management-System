# Query-Management-System
Data Structures project.
We assume a Query Management System that receives queries from users / applications and then proceeds to assign them to a set of Query Processors. When a query arrives the system records some information and then proceeds with the assignment. The information recorded is: (a) the query as an alphanumeric, (b) query type (update, select, join), (c) estimate of execution time (integer randomly generated in space [1,10], (d) priority of the query (integer randomly generated in space [1,5]).
